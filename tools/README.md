# Maintainer tools

Python scripts used to build parts of the app. They read the game files in `site/`, so they
only work on a PC that has them (see [docs/game-files.md](../docs/game-files.md)).
Run them from the repository root with Python 3.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make_icon.py` | Draws the app icon into `app/build/` |
| `perf_patch.py` | Writes the performance-patched game script into `app/mods/` |
| `lighting_patch.py` | Adds the Map lighting option (Enhanced / Original) to the patched game script in `app/mods/` |
| (hand edit) | Left-handed viewmodel fix in `Object3D.updateWorldMatrix` of the mods `BiMsX6Xn.js` (both copies): a parents-only update keeps `matrixWorldNeedsUpdate` set and a dirty parent forces the child, so a `getWorldPosition()` call can't swallow `hand.scale.x = -1` (upstream issues #4/#5). Re-apply by hand if the bundle is regenerated. |
| `bot_patch.py` | Human-like bots and the Enemy rank setting: edits the mods `BiMsX6Xn.js`, `CnrSARj_.js` and `OkAdunfX.js` (both copies) in place and makes the mods `C_VPDXvn.js` (replay playback) from `site/`. Details in the script's docstring. |
| `hitreg_patch.py` | Exact fire rate (and, in its second stage, the Perfect first shot option): edits the mods `CnrSARj_.js`, `OkAdunfX.js` and `C_VPDXvn.js` (both copies) in place. Details in the script's docstring. |
| `loadsafe_patch.py` | Map loading: a collision worker that never answers (60 s), crashes or can't load no longer hangs the load (main-thread build instead), plus `[aim-load]` console lines with stage timings, trainer download timing and retry warnings. Edits the mods `BiMsX6Xn.js` and `ChJ6FlD4.js` (both copies). |
| `rankpick_patch.py` | Rank picker on play: makes `wl` (the one lobby launch function) in the mods `ChJ6FlD4.js` (both copies) hand the drill to `window.__aimPlayGate` (`app/rank-picker.js`) first. Details in the script's docstring. |
| `fetch_rank_icons.py` | Downloads the rank icons into `app/mods/aim-ranks/` (run once; the PNGs are committed). |
| `make_training_set.py` | Generated the original 25 scenarios. New scenarios go straight into `scenarios/` instead. |

```bash
python -I tools/make_icon.py
```

## Patch order for the mods game scripts

The mods copies of the game scripts carry these changes, oldest first. `lighting_patch.py` and
`bot_patch.py` each refuse to run twice (they look for their own marker) and check that both
copies (`next/js/` and `_assets/r20261021-1/next/js/`) are identical before writing them.

1. `perf_patch.py` wrote the first mods `BiMsX6Xn.js` from `site/`. Later hand edits are not in
   it, so don't run it again on the current files.
2. `lighting_patch.py`
3. The left-handed viewmodel hand edit (table above).
4. `bot_patch.py`
5. `hitreg_patch.py` (needs `bot_patch.py`: it extends the bot options reader and the replay
   options). It runs in stages, each with its own marker; a run only adds the stages that are
   missing.
6. `loadsafe_patch.py`
7. `rankpick_patch.py` (refuses to run twice: it looks for `__aimPlayGate`)

Exact fire rate: every run started after `hitreg_patch.py` saves `exactFireRate: true` in its
replay meta, and a held trigger (continuous full-auto, hip or ADS) fires at the configured rate
(hip: Vandal 9.75/s, Phantom 11, Spectre 13.33, Odin 12). Older runs fired at the tick-rounded rate
(hip: 9.85, 10.67, 12.8, 11.64) and keep it in playback, so scores from before and after aren't
directly comparable for Phantom, Spectre and Odin sprays. Tap fire, bursts and bot fire timing are
unchanged.

`lighting_patch.py` and `bot_patch.py` don't touch the same code, so they give the same bytes in
either order. `app/main.js` also patches `OkAdunfX.js` while serving it (`SHOT_LOOP`,
`ROUTE_LOOP`); those strings are left alone by all of the above.

To start the bot patch over: `git checkout` the three mods files, delete both mods
`C_VPDXvn.js` copies, then run `python -I tools/bot_patch.py`.
